Every game engine revolves around abstractions you use to build your applications. In Godot, a game is a tree of nodes that you group together into scenes. You can then wire these nodes so they can communicate using signals.

## 1. Nodes 节点

Nodes are basic elements. A node could be: an iamge / a timer / a path / a skeleton / an area.

可以有数百个节点，将他们组合起来，创建成游戏的各个部分。

## 2. Scenes 场景

Scene主要有两个作用: It organize ndoes; It display nodes. Scene包含Node，显示Node，并组织Node。

可以将一个场景放置在另外一个场景中，这样就可以将节点组合成游戏对象。

## 3. Scene Tree

All your game's scenes come together in the scene tree, literally a tree of scenes. And as scenes are trees of nodes, the scene tree also is a tree of nodes. 

## 4. Signals

Nodes emit signals when some event occurs. This feature allows you to make nodes communicate without hard-wiring them in code.
