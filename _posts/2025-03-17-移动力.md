## 2. Delta 增量时间

```gdscript
# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
func _process(delta):
    pass
```

### 2.1 Movement

The movement speed of our game is determined by how fast the game runs(how many frames are generated)

当我们谈论游戏速度的时候，我们通常在谈论到底生成了多少帧。一台非常慢的电脑和一台非常快的电脑，这个差距是巨大的。

| Speed(pixels per frame) | Frames per second | Total movement(per second) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10px | 30 | 10 * 30 = 300 |
| 10px | 60 | 10 * 60 = 600 |
| 10px | 120 | 10 * 120 = 1200 |

Since come scenes are harder to render than others, it might even run inconsistently on the same system!

> Delta Time measures how long it took to create one frame.
> For example, if the framerate is 60fps, delta time is $1s \div 60 = 0.0167$ or about 17 milliseconds.
{: .prompt-tip }

This information we can use to keep the same at a constant speed regardless of framerate.

We essentially multiply any movement with the delta time.

### 2.2 How frame rates influence the game

| Speed(pixels per frame) | Frames per second | Delta time(seconds) | Original movement(per second) | Delta movement(per second) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10px | 30 | 1 / 30 = 0.033 | 10 * 30 = 300 | 10 * 30 * 0.033 = 10 | 
| 10px | 60 | 1 / 60 = 0.017 | 10 * 60 = 600 | 10 * 60 * 0.017 = 10 |
| 10px | 120 | 1 / 120 = 0.008 | 10 * 120 = 1200 | 10 * 120 * 0.008 = 10 |

With delta accounted, the game runs at the same speed at any framerate!
